The Ghost publishing platform is a fantastic choice for blogging, and installing it on Ubuntu 22.04 involves a few steps to set up the necessary dependencies and Ghost itself.

Ghost is a Node.js application, and it typically uses MySQL for its database and Nginx as a reverse proxy. It also has a command-line interface (Ghost-CLI) that simplifies the installation and management process.

Here's a detailed guide on how to install Ghost Editor (which is the Ghost platform) on Ubuntu 22.04:

**Prerequisites:**

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

1.  **Ubuntu 22.04 Server:** A fresh instance of Ubuntu 22.04.
2.  **Sudo User:** A non-root user with `sudo` privileges.
3.  **Basic Server Setup:**
      * **Updates:**
        ```bash
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt upgrade -y
        ```
      * **Firewall:** Ensure UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) is enabled and allows SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS traffic.
        ```bash
        sudo ufw allow OpenSSH
        sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full' # We'll set up Nginx later
        sudo ufw enable
        sudo ufw status
        ```

**Step-by-Step Installation:**

### 1\. Install Nginx

Nginx will serve as the web server and reverse proxy for Ghost.

```bash
sudo apt install nginx -y
sudo systemctl start nginx
sudo systemctl enable nginx
sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full' # Ensure this is allowed as mentioned in prerequisites
```

### 2\. Install MySQL

Ghost requires a MySQL database.

```bash
sudo apt install mysql-server -y
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```

During `mysql_secure_installation`, you'll be prompted to:

  * Set a strong root password.
  * Remove anonymous users.
  * Disallow root login remotely.
  * Remove the test database.

Now, create a dedicated database and user for Ghost. Replace `your_ghost_db`, `your_ghost_user`, and `your_ghost_password` with strong, unique values.

```bash
sudo mysql -u root -p

# Inside MySQL shell:
CREATE DATABASE your_ghost_db;
CREATE USER 'your_ghost_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'your_ghost_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON your_ghost_db.* TO 'your_ghost_user'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EXIT;
```

### 3\. Install Node.js

Ghost requires a specific version of Node.js. It's best to use a Node Version Manager (like NVM) or NodeSource PPA to ensure you get the correct and supported version. As of July 2025, Ghost generally supports LTS (Long Term Support) versions of Node.js. Let's use NodeSource to install the recommended LTS version (e.g., Node.js 18.x or 20.x).

First, install `curl`:

```bash
sudo apt install curl -y
```

Then, add the NodeSource PPA and install Node.js and npm:

```bash
# For Node.js 20.x (Recommended current LTS version for new Ghost installations)
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install -y nodejs

# Verify installation
node -v
npm -v
```

**Note:** Always check the [official Ghost documentation](https://ghost.org/docs/install/ubuntu/) for the currently recommended Node.js LTS version, as it might change.

### 4\. Install Ghost-CLI

The Ghost command-line interface makes managing Ghost installations easy.

```bash
sudo npm install ghost-cli@latest -g
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
ghost -v
```

### 5\. Create a Directory for Ghost

It's recommended to install Ghost in its own directory, typically under `/var/www/`.

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/ghost
sudo chown your_user:your_user /var/www/ghost # Replace your_user with your actual username
sudo chmod 775 /var/www/ghost
cd /var/www/ghost
```

**Important:** Replace `your_user` with the actual username of your non-root user that you're currently logged in as.

### 6\. Install Ghost

Now, you can use the Ghost-CLI to install Ghost.

```bash
ghost install
```

The `ghost install` command will prompt you for several details:

1.  **Ghost instance URL:** Enter the full URL where your Ghost blog will be accessible (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com`).
      * **Crucial:** If you plan to use SSL (which you absolutely should), use `https://`.
      * If you don't have a domain yet, you can use your server's IP address for testing, but remember to change it later.
2.  **MySQL hostname:** `localhost`
3.  **MySQL username:** `your_ghost_user` (the one you created earlier)
4.  **MySQL password:** `your_ghost_password` (the one you created earlier)
5.  **Ghost database name:** `your_ghost_db` (the one you created earlier)
6.  **Set up Nginx?** `Yes` (Ghost-CLI will configure Nginx for you)
7.  **Set up SSL?** `Yes` (Ghost-CLI will use Let's Encrypt for a free SSL certificate)
      * If you choose `Yes`, you'll need to provide your email address for Let's Encrypt.
      * If you don't have a domain and are using an IP, you might need to choose `No` for SSL initially and set it up manually later or obtain a domain.
8.  **Set up Systemd?** `Yes` (Ghost will be set up as a systemd service, so it starts automatically on boot)
9.  **Start Ghost?** `Yes`

The Ghost-CLI will then proceed to:

  * Install Ghost from npm.
  * Configure the `config.production.json` file.
  * Set up Nginx.
  * Generate SSL certificates with Let's Encrypt (if chosen).
  * Configure Systemd.
  * Start Ghost.

### 7\. Complete the Ghost Setup in Browser

Once the installation is complete, the Ghost-CLI will output a URL similar to:

```
Ghost was installed successfully!

Your admin interface is located at:

    https://yourdomain.com/ghost/
```

1.  Open your web browser and navigate to the `/ghost/` URL provided.
2.  Follow the on-screen instructions to create your administrator account (email, name, password).
3.  You'll then be redirected to your Ghost admin dashboard, where you can start writing and managing your blog\!

**Troubleshooting Tips:**

  * **Permissions:** Most issues arise from incorrect file permissions. Ensure your `your_user` has ownership of the `/var/www/ghost` directory.
  * **Node.js Version:** If you encounter errors during `ghost install`, double-check that you have an officially supported Node.js LTS version.
  * **Firewall:** Make sure ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) are open in UFW.
  * **Nginx Configuration:** If you're having Nginx issues, check the Nginx error logs: `sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log`
  * **Ghost Logs:** For Ghost-specific errors, check the Ghost logs in the `/var/www/ghost/content/logs` directory.
  * **Memory:** Ghost can be a bit memory-intensive during installation and operation. Ensure your server has at least 1GB of RAM (2GB is better). If memory is low, you might need to add swap space.
  * **DNS:** Ensure your domain's DNS records are correctly pointing to your server's IP address if you're using a custom domain.
